            "\n",
            "The Bell curve, also known as the normal distribution or Gaussian distribution, is a statistical representation of the distribution of a random variable that follows a specific pattern. It describes the likelihood of any particular value occurring.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Symmetric:** The curve is symmetrical around its mean (average) value.\n",
            "* **Peak:** The highest point of the curve occurs at the mean.\n",
            "* **Tails:** The curve extends indefinitely in both directions from the mean.\n",

            "**How the Bell Curve Works:**\n",
            "\n",
            "The probability of a value occurring is determined by its distance from the mean. Values close to the mean are more likely to occur, while values far from the mean are less likely.\n",

            "**Shape of the Curve:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Narrow:** A narrow curve indicates that values tend to cluster around the mean.\n",
            "* **Broad:** A broad curve indicates that values are more spread out from the mean.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Standard Deviation:**\n",
            "\n",
            "The standard deviation (Ïƒ) measures the spread of the curve. A higher standard deviation indicates that values are more dispersed.\n",

            "\n",
            "The 68-95-99.7 rule is a rule of thumb that describes the percentage of data that falls within certain ranges of the mean:\n",
            "\n",
            "* About 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation from the mean.\n",
            "* About 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations from the mean.\n",
            "* About 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations from the mean.\n",

            "The Bell curve is widely used in various fields, including:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Statistics:** Modeling and predicting the distribution of random variables.\n",
            "* **Biology:** Describing the distribution of traits in a population.\n",
            "* **Social sciences:** Understanding the distribution of scores on tests or surveys.\n",
